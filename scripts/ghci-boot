-- One-shot settings for GHCi. Note that this should not bind any
-- names. Instead, bindings are sourced from a secondary file which
-- needs to be re-run after every :load command.

-- Set prompt. The ANSI escapes have to be enclosed within SOH & STX
-- so that the line editor won’t mess up on long lines.

-- Bootstrap name bindings.

-- This redefines :load so that after adding the file to the target
-- set, all my standard bindings (including costom interactive print)
-- are set-up again.
:def load myLoad
:def reload myReload
:def rl myReload

-- Use my custom print function with unescaped unicode literals.
